# Inky 500

The second version of my data visualisation site for the racing league I participate in.

The first one, built with Vue and Vite and heavily inspired by the F1 standings board, is still up for seasons 2, 3 and 4 [here](https://jamiehenson.com/inky500-f1/) and the code is available [here](https://github.com/jamiehenson/inky500-f1).

This one is built around Astro and uses shadcn UI components, the latter of which comes with a React dependency. The reason for these choices is firstly to give me a chance to give Astro a go, and secondly to have a site that's more web-friendly and easier to maintain for the coming seasons.
